Artificial Inteligence Model Generation and Tokenization

# Desciption:

Use the minima network to build AI models on a distributed way, every node build a little part of
the model, being able to use all the sensors and capabilities that a mobile phone or a computer have
to help to build that model.

So a lot of models can be generated(Using distributed machine learning models) and tokenized by
both parties, the people who wants to participate on the generation of the model and the people who
wants to use the AI model generated.

A use case we thought, was to build a model to guide a blind person over the city, using the camera
mobile to detect objects, google maps to set a path and the AI Model would use all those inputs to
guide the blind person safety over the city.

No code has been done yet, as our expert on AI is building his own company on applying AI to
cancer detection, so we need AI experts to think about it and how to do it.

We need to search for experts on the AI area to build that.
